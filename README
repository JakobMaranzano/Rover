A repositor for the U of M Flint Rover.

The goal of this project was to create a remote control car.

Steps to the process:
1.A USB controler is conected to the computer
2.CollectingInfo.py takes the information and turns it into a number from 0-4 which realates to a direction
3.SendingMQTT.py takes that direction and publishes it to a MQTT server called Rover
4.MQTTSubscrber.py then runs on a raspbery pi that it subscribed to the Rover server and collects the most recent number
5.MQTTSubscriber then sends that number through a USB connection to an Arduino
6.MotorPower.ino then takes that number and sends out the 4 apropriate PMW signials to the motor controlers
7.The motor controler then takes that signal and using anout outside power souce runs the car
